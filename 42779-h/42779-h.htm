<h3>DEFOE'S PAMPHLET ON THE SEPTENNIAL BILL.</h3>

  <p>It is impossible to read Chalmers' and Wilson's <i>Lives of Defoe</i>
  without being constantly struck not merely by the want of all critical
  acumen and ordinary knowledge of the characteristics of Defoe's style
  which they display, but also by the absence of research on almost every
  point of importance connected with his career. Out of innumerable
  instances, I may mention his pamphlet on the subject of the Septennial
  Bill. Chalmers, and after him Wilson, are satisfied with repeating
  Boyer's statement that Defoe was the author of <i>The Triennial Bill
  Impartially Stated</i>, London, 1716; but neither of them appears to have
  referred to the pamphlet itself, and Wilson does not seem to have even
  consulted Boyer. He observes, "Mr. Chalmers thinks the pamphlet was not
  his." Whatever Chalmers might think, he does not certainly say so in
  express terms. The point itself is a curious one; and as it has not
  hitherto been gone into, perhaps I shall not trespass too much upon your
  space if I give your readers the results of my examination of it. In
  Boyer's <i>Political State for April</i>, 1716 (p. 484.), he enumerates
  in the following terms the pamphlets on the Septennial Bill:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>A Letter to a Country Gentleman, showing the Inconveniences which
  attend the Last Act for Triennial Parliaments</i>, which, I am informed,
  was written by the learned Dr. Tyndal. This was followed with others
  intitled, <i>An Epistle to a Whig Member of Parliament</i>; <i>Some
  Considerations on a Law for Triennial Parliaments</i>; <i>The Suspension
  of the Triennial Bill, the Properest Means to unite the Nation</i>; <i>A
  First and Second Letter to a Friend in Suffolk</i>; <i>The Alterations in
  the Triennial Act Considered</i>; <i>The Innkeeper's Opinion of the
  Triennial Act</i>; and a few others. The only pamphlet that was published
  on the other side was called <i>The Triennial Act Impartially Stated</i>,
  &amp;c. This pamphlet was judged, from its loose style and way of
  arguing, to be written by that prostituted fool of the last ministry,
  D&mdash;&mdash; D&mdash; F&mdash;; but whatever was offered either in
  print, or vivâ voce, against the Septennial Bill, was fully answered and
  confuted by the following writing, generally fathered on the ingenious
  and judicious Joseph Addison, Esq."</p>

</blockquote>

<p><!-- Page 578 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page578"></a>{578}</span></p>

  <p>Then follows (pp. 485-501.) a printer of a pamphlet, certainly an able
  one, entitled:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Arguments about the Alteration of Triennial Elections of Parliament.
  In a Letter to a Friend in the Country."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In the following year, when Defoe had occasion to notice <i>The
  Minutes of the Negociations of Mons. Mesnager</i>, 1717, 8vo., the
  well-known work which has been so frequently attributed to him, in a
  letter in the public prints, which letter seems entirely to have escaped
  all his biographers, and yet is of the most interesting description, he
  adverts to the above charge of being the author of <i>The Triennial Act
  Impartially Stated</i>, in the followings words:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"About a year since, viz., when the debates were on foot for enlarging
  the time for the sitting of the present Parliament, commonly called
  repealing the Triennial Bill, a stranger, whom I never knew, wrote a warm
  pamphlet against it; and I, on the other hand, wrote another about a week
  before it. Mr. Boyer, with his usual assurance, takes notice of both
  these books in his monthly work, and bestows some praises, more than I
  think it deserved, upon one; but falls upon the other with great fury,
  naming, after much ill language, D. D. F. to be the author of it, which,
  he said, might be known by the inconsistency of the style, or to that
  effect. Now that the world may see what a judge this Frenchman is of the
  English style, and upon what slender ground he can slander an innocent
  man, I desire it may be noted, that it has been told him by his own
  friends, and I offer now to prove it to him by three unquestionable
  witnesses, <i>that the book which he praised so impertinently I was the
  author of, and that book which he let fly his dirt upon I had no concern
  in</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This declaration of Defoe, which claims to him the pamphlet fastened
  on the "ingenious and judicious Joseph Addison, Esq.," and repudiates
  that "judged to be written by that prostituted fool of the last ministry,
  D&mdash;&mdash; D&mdash; F&mdash;," will amuse your readers, as it seems
  to form an admirable commentary on the text&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"And every blockhead knows me by my style."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>We can fully accept his disclaimer of <i>The Triennial Act Impartially
  Stated</i>. It is, however, singular enough that the style of the
  <i>Arguments about the Alteration of Triennial Elections of
  Parliament</i>, without attaching too much importance to that criterion,
  is not the style of Defoe; and the Bill of Commerce with France is
  denounced in it in such terms as "that destructive bill," "that fatal
  bill," as one can scarcely suppose, without entertaining a meaner opinion
  of him than I feel assured he deserves, he could or would, under any
  circumstances, have made use of. To carry this Bill of Commerce he
  exerted all his great powers as a writer, and supported it in the
  <i>Review</i> and the <i>Mercator</i>, in the <i>Essay on the Treaty of
  Commerce with France</i> (1713, 8vo.), and in two other tracts, both of
  which were unknown to Chalmers and Wilson, and have never been noticed or
  included in the list of his works, namely, <i>Some Thoughts upon the
  Subject of Commerce with France: by the Author of the Review</i> (Baker,
  1713, 8vo.), and <i>A general History of Trade, in which an Attempt is
  made to state and moderate the present Disputes about settling a Commerce
  between Great Britain and France for the Month of September</i> (Baker,
  1713); being the fourth Number of the <i>History of Trade</i>, which
  Wilson says "extended only to two Numbers" (vol. iii. p. 339.). In the
  <i>Appeal to Honour and Justice</i>, published only the year before
  (1715), he supports the same cause with all his strength. He vindicates
  the part he had taken, and says&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"This was my opinion, and is so still; and I would venture to maintain
  it against any man upon a public stage, before a jury of fifty merchants,
  and venture my life upon the cause, if I were assured of fair play in the
  dispute."&mdash;<i>Works</i>, edit. 1841, vol. xx. p. 43.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>His opinion on the policy of the bill, as appears by all his
  subsequent commercial works, never changed: and that he could so speak of
  it in this pamphlet (<i>Arguments about the Alteration, &amp;c.</i>),
  supposing it to be his, seems almost incredible. I feel convinced that no
  other similar instance can be found, during the whole of his career, in
  which he can be shown to express himself with such a total disregard of
  his avowed opinions and his honest convictions. Were it certain that he
  had done so, then the character which the Tolands, Oldmixons, and Boyers
  have given of him, as ready to take up any cause for hire, and as the
  prostituted agent of a party, and which I believe to be a base slander,
  would indeed be well deserved. But it will be asked how, after so
  apparently distinct and explicit an avowal, can it be doubted that he was
  the author of the pamphlet in question? I can only account for it on the
  supposition that Defoe, in writing from recollection of what Boyer had
  stated, in the following year, confounded the pamphlet praised with one
  of the pamphlets noticed. It appears to me that one of them, the full
  title of which is <i>Some Considerations on a Law for Triennial
  Parliaments, with an enquiry</i>, 1. <i>Whether there may not be a time
  when it is necessary to suspend the execution even of such Laws as are
  most essential to the Liberties of the People?</i> 2. <i>Whether this is
  such a time or no?</i> (London, printed for J. Baker and T. Warner, at
  the Black Boy, in Paternoster Row, 1716, pp. 40.), and which is noticed
  in Boyer's list, has infinitely more both of Defoe's style and manner of
  treating a subject than the other pamphlet. I entertain no doubt that it
  was written by him, though it has never hitherto been attributed to him;
  and it is far from being unlikely that his recollection may have deceived
  him and that he may have thought that Boyer's praise applied to this
  pamphlet, written on the same side, and not to the other. It <!-- Page
  579 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page579"></a>{579}</span>will be
  observed that Defoe does not give the title of the pamphlet, and that he
  does not notice that it was attributed by Boyer to Addison; which he
  would scarcely have omitted doing if he had written his letter with
  Boyer's words before him, in which also the term "inconsistency" is not
  used. Such is my solution of the difficulty, which unexplained would
  throw a new, and certainly a very unfavourable light on Defoe's character
  as a pamphleteer and politician.</p>

<h3>ARTHUR O'CONNOR.</h3>

  <p>From the French recent papers we learn that Arthur O'Connor, one of
  the prominent actors in the Irish Rebellion of 1798, has just closed his
  prolonged life at his residence, the Château de Bignon, near Nemours
  (Seine et Marne) in France. When, in 1834, by permission of the
  government of Lord Grey, he and his accomplished wife were in this city
  (Cork), with the view of disposing of his inherited and not confiscated
  property, in order to invest the produce in France, I was almost in daily
  intercourse with them; and, from my recollection of the lady's father,
  the Marquis de Condorcet, a distinguished mathematician, but better known
  as the biographer and ardent propagator of Voltaire's infidel principles,
  as well as the zealous partisan of the Revolution, though finally its
  victim, I was always a welcome visitor. O'Connor, whom Bonaparte had
  raised to the rank of General of Division, equivalent to that of General
  in full in our service, being next to the degree of Marshal, told me that
  the disunion and personal altercations of the Irish Legion engaged in the
  service of the then republican France had deservedly and utterly
  estranged and disgusted the French successive rulers, particularly
  Napoleon, in whose triumphs they consequently were not allowed to
  participate as a national body. The rancorous duel between two officers,
  McSweeny and Corbet, both from Cork, had made a deep impression on the
  great soldier, and the Legion was disbanded. Having inquired from
  O'Connor whether he did not intend to publish the events of his
  variegated life, he told me that he was preparing the narrative; but, on
  mentioning to his wife that he had made this acknowledgment, she
  immediately called on me with an earnest request that I would dissuade
  him from doing so. She did not explain her motive, and I only promised to
  avoid the future renewal of the subject in our conversations. As yet,
  whatever preparations he may have made, the press has not been resorted
  to; though, if in existence, as may be presumed, the work, or its
  materials, will not, most probably, be suffered to remain in closed and
  mysterious secrecy. The Memoirs, for so he entitled it, cannot fail to be
  most interesting; for he was a man of truth, and incapable of
  misrepresentation, though, of course, liable to misconception, in his
  recital of events; nor can it be denied, that a history, in any degree
  worthy of the theme&mdash;that is, of the Irish Rebellion, is still
  unpublished.<a name="footnotetag1" href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
  Whatever objection may have prevented the publication during his life,
  none, I should suppose and hope, can now be urged after his death, which,
  singularly enough, in an article devoted to him in the <i>Biographie
  Universelle</i>, I find as having occurred so long since as 1830. His
  son, too, is there represented as the husband of his own mother! the
  writer, with other confusions of facts, having mistaken Arthur for his
  elder brother, Roger O'Connor, father of the present eccentric Feargus,
  M.P. It is thus, too, that the great vocalist Braham is in the same
  voluminous repository stated to have died of the cholera in August, 1830,
  though, several years subsequently, I saw him in hale flesh and blood;
  but the compilation, valuable, it must be admitted, in French biography,
  teems with ludicrous blunders on English lives, which, in the new edition
  now in state of preparation, will, I hope, be corrected. Even the
  articles of Newton, though by Biot, and of Shakspeare and Byron by
  Villemain, are not much to their credit, particularly the latter, in
  which the national prejudices prominently emerge.</p>

  <p>O'Connor, after having for sixteen years occupied apartments in the
  house of an eminent bookseller and printer, Monsieur Renouard, in the Rue
  de Tournan, leading to the Luxembourg, and the only street that I
  remember, now sixty years since, had a flagged footpath in that, at
  present, embellished metropolis, purchased his late residence, the
  Château de Bignon, with the proceeds of his paternal estates sold here,
  as previously stated, in 1834. The purchase was made from the heirs of
  Mirabeau, who was born in that mansion, and not in Provence, as generally
  supposed, because that southern province was the family's original seat.
  The great orator's father, distinguished, <i>per antiphrasim</i>, as
  "l'Ami des hommes," for he was the most unamiable of men, had acquired
  and removed to the castle so called, in order to approach the royal court
  of Versailles. The renowned son's bursts of eloquence still, I may say,
  resound in my ears, dazzling and entrancing my judgment, as Lord Chatham
  is reported similarly to have affected his hearers. Yet my old friend
  Vergniaux's genuine oratory and reasoning power struck me as far
  superior; and I can well believe that Chatham's son's were to those of
  his father, which his contemporary, Hume, no incompetent judge, and
  doubtless his <!-- Page 580 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page580"></a>{580}</span>hearer, by no means exalts, though the
  effects on his parliamentary audience appear to have been so
  extraordinary. "At present," writes Hume (Essay xiii.), "there are above
  half-a-dozen speakers in the two houses, who, in the judgment of the
  public, have reached very nearly the same pitch of eloquence, and no man
  pretends to give any one a preference over the next. This seems to me a
  certain proof that none of them have attained much beyond mediocrity in
  this art." Hume's <i>Essays</i> first appeared in 1742, when the elder
  Pitt was, indeed, young in parliament; but he survived till 1776, during
  which interval Chatham's fame reached its culminating point. Yet, in all
  the ensuing editions, the author never thought it necessary to modify his
  depreciation of British eloquence.</p>

  <p>O'Connor, it is said, published his father-in-law Condorcet's
  <i>collective</i> works; but whether the edition of 1804 in 21 volumes is
  meant, I cannot determine, though I know no other; nor does this contain
  his mathematical writings. While outlawed in 1793 with the Girondist
  faction, he evaded, from October to March, 1794, the revolutionary
  search, when he poisoned himself, unwilling, he said, in some verses
  addressed to his wife, the sister of Marshal Grouchy, further to
  participate in the horrors of the period, though he had been most
  instrumental in preparing the way for them. He chose, however, the better
  side, in his conception, of the proposed alternative or dilemma:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Ils m'ont dit: Choisis d'être oppresseur ou victime;</p>
      <p>J'embrassai le malheur, et leur laissai le crime."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Madame O'Connor, a child of five years old at her father's death, had
  a very faint recollection of him; but I perfectly remember him, with his
  ardent look, and, while still young, a grey head,&mdash;"a volcano
  covered with snow," as was observed of him. O'Connor's only child, a mild
  gentlemanly young man, but certainly not the inheritor of his parent's
  talents, predeceased him, so that no descendant, either of Condorcet or
  O'Connor, now survives.</p>

<h3>INEDITED POETRY.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. v., pp. 387. 435.)</p>

  <p>By way of concluding my notes upon the MS. volume of poetry, from
  which I have already transcribed two pieces (inserted at pages 387. 485.
  of your present volume), I now send you the short poem referred to in my
  first communication:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i4hg3">"February 15th, past two in the morning.</p>
      <p class="i12">Going to bed very ill.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Oh, when shall I, from pain and sorrow free,</p>
      <p>Enjoy calm rest, and lasting peace with thee!</p>
      <table><tr><td>When will my weary pilgrimage be o'er,<br/>When shall my soul from earth to heav'n soar,<br/>And, freed from flesh, the God of Gods adore.</td><td><img src="images/rbrace.png" class="middle" style="height:6ex;" alt="brace" title="brace" /></td></tr></table>
      <p>Oh thou who only knowest what is best,</p>
      <p>Give me, oh give me, peace, content and rest!</p>
      <p>In life and death, oh be thou ever nigh,</p>
      <p>And my great weakness with thy strength supply.</p>
      <p>If on the bed of sickness I am laid,</p>
      <p>Then let me find that thou can'st give me aid.</p>
      <p>My drooping soul may thy blest Spirit che<i>a</i>r,</p>
      <p>And dissipate d<i>i</i>sponding gloomy fear.</p>
      <p>May the bright angels watch around my bed,</p>
      <p>And keep my timorous soul from fear and dread.</p>
      <p>And should excess of agony or pain,</p>
      <p>Or fever's rage o'er reason longest gain;</p>
      <p>Even then protect me by thy mighty power,</p>
      <p>Oh save me, save me, in that dreadful hour!</p>
      <p>Make every thought such as thou mayst approve,</p>
      <p>And every word show I my Maker love.</p>
      <p>If void of reason I should think, or say,</p>
      <p><i>O</i>ught that's improper, wash such stain<i>e</i>s away.</p>
      <p>Resign'd unto thy will let me submit,</p>
      <p>With joy to whatsoe<i>v</i>er thou think'st fit.</p>
      <p>In peace let me resign my latest breath,</p>
      <p>And, void of fear, meet the grim tyrant death.</p>
      <p>My parting soul let me to God entrust,</p>
      <p>And hope a Resurrection with the just."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The devotional feeling displayed in these lines, and the circumstances
  under which they were composed, will probably render them interesting to
  some of your readers. The other poems in the little volume relate chiefly
  to the death of her beloved husband. I should have sent one of these had
  I thought them suitable to your columns. Suffice it to say, that her
  grief for her bereavement seems only to have been equalled by her
  affectionate reminiscences of the piety and excellence of the departed
  bishop, and only to have been assuaged by the "sure and certain hope"
  which filled her mind. The Queries which I would found upon the MS. are
  two in number:</p>

  <p>1. What is the precise date of the author's death?</p>

  <p>2. The meaning (if any) of the subscription to the piece printed at
  page 435.?</p>

  <p>Permit me to notice a trifling error of the press, p. 387. col. 2. l.
  21, for <i>then</i> read <i>them</i>; and to thank you for the space
  given to these three communications.</p>

  <p>P.S.&mdash;Since writing the above I have seen the observation of your
  correspondent C. B., p. 523.: I cannot think the meaning of the signature
  so evident as he implies. His reason for the use of the name Juba is
  evidently correct: I am indebted to him for the suggestion, and must
  confess that the coincidence had escaped me. With regard to the word
  Issham, had it been intended to signify that the former name was
  "assumed, or false," it would certainly have been written I-sham, as C.
  B. evidently feels. It is <i>possible</i> that this part of the signature
  may have no meaning: this I must leave for some other correspondent to
  determine.</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>

  <p><i>Lancashire May-day Custom.</i>&mdash;On the 1st of May, the
  following custom is observed in some parts of Lancashire, though now very
  nearly obsolete.</p>

  <p>Late on the preceding night, or early on that morning, small branches
  of trees are placed at the doors of houses in which reside any
  marriageable girls. They are emblematical of the character of the
  maidens, and have a well understood language of their own, which is
  rhythmical. Some speak flatteringly, others quite the reverse: the latter
  being used when the character of the person for whom it is intended is
  not quite "above suspicion."</p>

  <p>A malicious rustic wag may sometimes put a branch of the latter
  description where it is not deserved, but I believe this is an
  exception.</p>

  <p>I only remember a few of the various trees which are laid under
  contribution for this purpose. The following will illustrate what I am
  writing about. I must premise that <i>wicken</i> is the local name for
  mountain ash:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p><i>Wicken</i>, sweet chicken.</p>
      <p><i>Oak</i>, for a joke.</p>
      <p><i>Ash</i>, trash.</p>
      <p><i>Gorse in bloom</i>&mdash;rhymes with at noon,</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>(I omit the epithet given here, as commonly, to an unchaste woman),
  and is used for a notorious delinquent.</p>

  <p><i>Hair cut off, an Antidote.</i>&mdash;A few days ago I observed my
  old servant thrusting something into the ear of one of my cows. Upon
  inquiry, I was informed that it was hair cut off the calf's tail, the
  said calf having been taken away from the cow on the previous morning:
  the butcher cut it off, for the above purpose, "to make her forget the
  calf." I half resolved on sending this account to "N. &amp; Q.," but I
  hesitated, under the idea that it would perhaps hardly be worth the
  while. But this afternoon my eye caught the following scrap in a
  newspaper just published:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"At Oldham, last week, a woman summoned the owner of a dog that had
  bitten her. She said that she should not have adopted this course had the
  owner of the animal given her some of its hair, to ensure her against any
  evil consequences following the bite."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>There is so much similarity in the two cases, that I now would ask
  whether your readers can throw any light on the subject?</p>

  <p><i>Weather Prophecy&mdash;The Oak Tree and the Ash</i> (Vol. v., p.
  534.).&mdash;When the oak comes out before the ash, there will be fine
  weather in harvest. I have remarked this for several years, and find it
  generally correct, as far as such things can be.</p>

<h3>THE DIPHTHONG "AI."</h3>

  <p>Speaking of the diphthong <i>ai</i>, Walker, in the "Principles of
  English Pronunciation" prefixed to his <i>Dictionary</i>, says (Art.
  202.):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The sound of this diphthong is exactly like the long slender sound of
  <i>a</i>; thus, <i>pail</i> a vessel, and <i>pale</i> a colour, are
  perfectly the same sound."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This sound is analysed (Art. 225.) as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"This triphthong (<i>aye</i>) is a combination of the slender sound of
  <i>a</i>, heard in <i>pa-per</i>; and the <i>e</i> in metre."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The sound, therefore, is a combination of <i>two simple</i> sounds.
  But in a previous article (8.) <i>a</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>o</i> are called
  <i>simple</i> vowels; or (according to his definition):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Those which are formed by <i>one</i> conformation of the organs only;
  that is, the organs remain exactly in the <i>same</i> position at the
  <i>end</i> as at the <i>beginning</i> of the letter; whereas, in the
  <i>compound</i> vowels <i>i</i> and <i>u</i>, the organs <i>alter</i>
  their position before the letter is completely sounded."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Walker, therefore, makes the sound to be "<i>combination</i> of <i>two
  simple</i> sounds," although he had already declared it to be a
  <i>simple</i> sound. Now, strange to say, Dr. Richardson, in his very
  valuable contribution to our literature, viz. his 8vo. <i>Dictionary</i>
  (a veritable <i>Richardson</i>, very long ago foretold by Joe Miller), is
  guilty of the same inconsistency. In the "Grammatical and Etymological
  Examination adapted to the Dictionary," he reckons <i>thirteen simple</i>
  vowels in our language. The <i>tenth</i> is the "long slender sound of
  <i>a</i>," as Walker would call it; and the sound is given us (according
  to Richardson) in these words: "<i>Lame</i>, <i>Tame</i>, <i>Crane</i>,
  <i>Faint</i>, and <i>Layman</i>." My Query is, ought not this sound to be
  transferred from the <i>simple vowels</i> under the <i>true
  diphthongs</i>? And ought we not to distinguish between the pronunciation
  of <i>pail</i> and <i>pale</i>, just as we do between <i>neigh</i>, and
  <i>né</i> (French); <i>bait</i> and <i>bête</i> (French); or between
  <i>pay</i> and <i>pe</i> (Welsh); <i>tay</i> and <i>te</i> (Welsh)? It is
  worthy of remark, that the Welsh language has only the <i>simple</i>
  sound, <i>not</i> the <i>diphthongal</i>?</p>

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>A Bit o' fine Writin'.</i>&mdash;In the Preface to certain
  <i>Lectures on Ecclesiastes</i>, recently published, there occurs a
  choice scientific illustration, the "intellectual vastitude" whereof
  "necessitates a certain catholicity" of acquirements possessed by few
  readers. The author is referring to Jerome, and says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The most painful thing in his writings is the tone of <i>litigious
  infelicity</i> by which they are pervaded. It is a sort of <i>formic acid
  which flows from the finger-points not of our good father alone, but of a
  whole class of <!-- Page 582 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page582"></a>{582}</span>divines; and, like the red marks left by
  the feet of ants on litmus-paper, it discolours all his pages</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>There are two vignettes in the work: one illustrates "Consider the
  lilies," concerning which the artist had the benefit of an eminent
  botanist's opinion, to ensure correctness in the design. The other
  represents Solomon in all his glory, <i>driving his own chariot</i>,
  holding the reins in his right hand, and a sceptre or "morning-star" in
  his left hand. Methinks this illustration would not have passed muster
  with Mr. Scharf or Dr. Braun.</p>

  <p><i>Custom of Cranes in Storms.</i>&mdash;Some of your readers may be
  able further to illustrate the customs which I mention:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Ex avibus est præsagium c&oelig;li. When the crane taketh up a stone
  and flies with it in his <i>foot</i>, it is a sign of a
  storm."&mdash;Bishop Andrewes' <i>Orphan Lectures</i>, p. 92.: Lond.
  1657, fol.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Nonnus describes cranes as carrying stones in their <i>mouths</i> to
  prevent them from being carried hither and thither by the violence of
  winds and storms.&mdash;<i>Dyonysiacks</i>, lib. xii. p. 689.: Antwerp,
  1569.</p>

  <p>Bishop J. Taylor mentions a similar custom in the case of geese, but
  there is a different reason assigned for it:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Ælian tells of the geese flying over the mountain Taurus: <span

  ii. p. 595. Where else may it be met with? It is assuredly a better
  designation than that of "Mrs. Ald. A.," or "The Lady of Ald. B.;" and,
  from its occurrence in this place, seems to be a term once in use:</p>

  two works expressly on this subject, but we have not any of the kind.</p>

  <p>I have a volume now before me, concerning the author of which I now
  seek for information, as he was one of those who entered the lists with
  Junius, and addressed him under the signature of "An Advocate in the
  Cause of the People." One of his letters is reprinted in vol. i. p. 429.
  of (I am sorry to say) the unsatisfactory edition of the <i>Letters of
  Junius</i> recently published by Mr. Bohn; but the editor does not seem
  to have known the name of this "Advocate." This I learn from the work in
  question: <i>Hope's Curious and Comic Miscellaneous Works, started in his
  Walks</i>: London, printed for the Author, 8vo. without year or printer's
  name; but the Preface is dated April 24, 1780, and the Dedication is
  signed "John Hope," who had, he tells us, "once the honour of sitting" in
  the House of Commons; and he also informs us that Falkner wrote part of
  the poem <i>The Shipwreck</i> under his roof. Besides many amusing
  articles in prose and verse, the volume contains twenty-one papers
  entitled "The Leveller," which I believe originally appeared periodically
  in the <i>Westminster Mag.</i>; but I do not find them noticed by Drake
  in his Essays on that class of literature.</p>

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>OLD MUSIC.</h3>

  <p>I feel thankful to <span class="sc">Dr. Rimbault</span> for the "Old
  Concert Bill" which you have printed in Vol. v., p. 556., and wish it may
  lead to more contributions towards what does not exist, but is much to be
  wished for, a history of <i>instrumental</i> music in this country.
  Having had this subject in my mind a good while, and having had occasion
  to observe how defective and erroneous the supposed sources of
  information are, I have from time to time made memoranda, which would be
  at the service of anybody who would undertake such a <!-- Page 583
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page583"></a>{583}</span>work as the
  correction of the <i>Dictionary of Musicians</i>, or the compilation of a
  more complete work. My notes indeed are not of much importance, but it is
  the kind of case in which every little helps. In this concert bill, for
  instance, relating to a first-rate performance, we have five names,
  Grano, Dieupart, Pippo, Vebar, and Baston, which are not in the
  Dictionary. As to the first, I only know him by a set of solos for a
  violin or flute, which I have; of the next three, I know nothing; and of
  the last, I did not know that he performed Woodcock's music, or indeed
  that he performed at all, though I knew him as a composer. And in a
  volume now lying before me, "XII Concertos" by Woodcock are followed by
  "Six Concertos in Six Parts for Violins and Flutes, viz.: a Fifth, Sixth,
  and Concert Flute: the proper Flute being nam'd to each Concerto;
  composed by Mr. John Baston," and printed for Walsh. He is not, however,
  named either as a composer or performer in the Dictionary. It may be said
  that these are obscure persons; but that is the very reason why some
  slight, plain notice of them should exist somewhere; for the history of
  an art is not well written, or well understood, if there is not some easy
  way of learning more or less about the obscure persons who are every now
  and then coming on the stage.</p>

  <p>To this note, may I be allowed to add a couple of Queries which
  perhaps some musical reader may be able and willing to answer.</p>

  <p>1. Who was "<i>Joseph</i> Jackson, Batchelor in Music, late of St.
  John's College, Oxford;" and did he compose anything beside six sonatas
  for two violins and a violoncello, which were "printed for the widow by
  Thompson and Son in St. Paul's Churchyard," I suppose (from some other
  "just published" music advertised on the title-page) about a century
  ago?</p>

  <p>2. I have also&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Six Trio pour deux Violons et Alto Viola ou Basse obligé. Composés
  par Mr. Bach; mis au jour par Mr. Huberty de l'Academie Royale de

<h3>TREASURY OF ST. MARK'S; RECORD AT TIBERIUS.</h3>

  <p>In Howell's <i>Familiar Letters</i>, edit. 1726, p. 62., he says that
  he saw in the Treasury of St. Mark's, Venice, a <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'hugh'."
  >huge</span> iron chest as tall as himself&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"that hath no lock, but a crevice through which they cast in the gold
  that's bequeathed to St. Mark in legacies, whereon is engraven this proud
  motto:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'Quando questo scrinio S'apria,</p>
      <p>Tutto 'l Mundo tremera.'</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>'When this chest is opened, the whole world shall tremble.'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Is there any other account of this chest, or of its having been
  opened, as it was evidently reserved for some great necessity? Did not
  the exigencies of the state, during its decline, compel the Venetians to
  resort to it; if not, such a treasure could hardly escape the lynx-eyed
  rapacity of some one of the many spoilers to whom the unfortunate city
  has been subject. At p. 275. he gives an account of having read in
  <i>Suidas</i>, that in his time a record existed at Tiberius which was
  found in the Temple at Jerusalem when it was destroyed, which affirms
  that our Saviour was in his lifetime upon earth chosen a priest of the
  Temple, and registered therein as "Jesus Christ, the Son of God and of
  the Virgin Mary." Howell requests the opinion of Dr. Usher, Lord Primate
  of Ireland, on the subject. Is there any corroborative evidence that such
  a register existed?</p>

<h3>UNICORN.</h3>

  <p>Can any of your correspondents refer me to an account of the supposed
  habits of this animal, which in these matter-of-fact days we must, I
  presume, be content to consider as fabulous? I am desirous to know from
  what source we derive the stories of the animosity between the lion and
  unicorn, and the curious way of catching the latter, which are referred
  to in Spenser's <i>Faerie Queen</i>, Act II. Sc. 5. 10.:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i1hg3">"Like as a lyon, whose imperiall powre,</p>
      <p class="i1">A prowd rebellious unicorn defyes,</p>
      <p class="i1">T'avoide the rash assault and wrathful stowre</p>
      <p class="i1">Of his fiers foe, him a tree applyes,</p>
      <p class="i1">And when him ronning in full course he spyes,</p>
      <p class="i1">He slips aside; the whiles that furious beast</p>
      <p class="i1">His precious horne, sought of his enemyes,</p>
      <p class="i1">Strikes in the stocke, ne thence can be releast,</p>
      <p>But to the mighty victor yields a bounteous feast."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Shakspeare also (<i>Julius Cæsar</i>, Act II. Sc. 1.) speaks of the
  supposed mode of entrapping them:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i8hg3">"For he loves to hear,</p>
      <p>That unicorns may be betrayed with trees,</p>
      <p>And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,</p>
      <p>Lions with toils, and men with flatterers."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The ancients were most liberal with their descriptions of fabulous
  animals, and the Monoceros or Unicorn was a favourite subject with them;
  but I am not aware whether or no the account which Spencer gives has so
  early an origin.</p>

  <p>The connexion of the unicorn with the lion in the royal arms of this
  country naturally forces itself upon the attention, and I find that the
  present arms were settled at the accession of George I. We owe the
  introduction of the unicorn, however, to James I.; who, as King of
  Scotland, bore two unicorns, and coupled one with the English lion when
  the two kingdoms were <!-- Page 584 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page584"></a>{584}</span>united. Perhaps some of your
  correspondents can inform me how two unicorns became the "supporters" of
  the "achievement" of the Scottish kings.</p>

  <p>The position of the lion and unicorn in the arms of our country seems
  to have given rise (and naturally enough in the mind of one who was
  ignorant of heraldic decoration) to a nursery rhyme, which I well
  remember to have learnt:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The lion and the unicorn</p>
      <p>Were fighting for the crown,</p>
      <p>The lion beat the unicorn</p>

<h3>FLANAGAN ON THE ROUND TOWERS OF IRELAND.</h3>

  <p>Can you tell me anything of the history of a little work, of which the
  following is the title?&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A Discourse of the Round Towers of Ireland, in which the errors of
  the various writers on that subject are detected and confuted, and the
  true cause of so many differences among the learned, on the question of
  their use and history, is assigned and demonstrated. By John Flanagan,
  Kilkenny. Printed for the author by Thomas Kelly, 1843."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It was purchased by a Dublin bookseller at Jones' last sale
  (Catalogue, No. 704.), for 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> The bookseller, who has
  kindly lent me the book, says that it was never printed in Kilkenny, and
  that it is very scarce, he having seen only one other copy of it. It is a
  small quarto of twenty-four pages, beautifully printed on good paper,
  which leads me also to believe that the book could not have been printed
  in Kilkenny. The author, whoever he was or is, boldly says that, "There
  are no Round Towers in Ireland," p. 8., and through the pages of the work
  runs a vein of nonsense, which would lead a person to think that the
  author was not very right in his mind. Still, there is something very
  remarkable in the production.</p>

<h2>Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>St. Augustine's Six Treatises on Music.</i>&mdash;Dupin mentions
  St. Augustine's <i>Six Treatises on Music</i>: do these exist in print?
  if so, in what edition are they to be found?</p>

  <p class="author">E. A. H. L.</p>

  <p><i>Bishop Merriman.</i>&mdash;A few years ago inquiry was
  unsuccessfully made in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, and elsewhere
  both in England and Ireland for some particulars of John Merriman, the
  first Protestant Bishop of Down and Connor.</p>

  <p>In Cox's <i>Hibernia Anglicana</i> it appears that "Loftus, Archbishop
  of Armagh, was consecrated by the Popish Archbishop Curwin; Thomas
  Lancaster, the first Protestant Bishop of Kildare, was consecrated by
  Archbishop Brown; and John Merriman, the first Protestant Bishop of Down
  and Connor, was consecrated by Lancaster when Primate."</p>

  <p>This Bishop Merriman had been chaplain to Queen Elizabeth; he was made
  Vicar of St. John's, Atheboy, in the first year of her reign, and was
  consecrated Bishop of Down and Connor, Jan. 19, 1568/9. He died in
  1572.</p>

  <p>The probable father of Bishop Merriman may be found in the <i>Rutland
  Papers</i>, published by the Camden Society, where <i>Mr. Meryman</i>, in
  a second list called <i>William Meryman</i>, who held some office in the
  "Kechyn," is selected as one of the attendants on Henry VIII. and Queen
  Katherine to the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520.</p>

  <p>There was formerly a family of the name of Merriman residing in
  Ireland: does it now exist? In England there are several families of this
  name: are any of them descended from this source?</p>

  <p><i>The Escubierto.</i>&mdash;Where can the effusions of the Capateiro
  da Bandarra be seen in England? And has any of your correspondents read
  them, so as to be able to explain the nature of his language and teaching
  concerning the Escubierto? I believe it is admitted, that the doctrine of
  the Sebastianistas is superadded, exegetically, to that of the Capateiro,
  and is not to be found in him.</p>

  <p><i>J. Scandret.</i>&mdash;I should be much obliged for any information
  respecting "J. Scandret, priest of the Church of England," the author of
  a little treatise entitled <i>Sacrifice, the Divine Service</i>,
  originally published in 1707; with a recommendation from the celebrated
  Charles Leslie, Chancellor of Connor. Mr. Parker, of Oxford, reprinted it
  in 1840; but as "N. &amp; Q." had not then begun its useful career, the
  editor was unable to satisfy that curiosity which most readers feel
  respecting the authors of such books as merit their attention.</p>

  <p class="author">E. H. A.</p>

  <p><i>Mary Horton.</i>&mdash;I find in Burke's <i>Extinct Baronetage</i>,
  p. 269. (article "Horton of Chadderton"), that "William Horton, of Coley,
  in Halifax parish, died in 1739-40: by Mary his wife, daughter of
  (Thomas) Chester, Esq., he left an only daughter, <i>Mary</i>, living and
  unmarried in 1766." Can any one inform me whether this Mary Horton ever
  <i>married</i>, when she <i>died</i>, and where she was buried?</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Tewars.</span></p>

  <p><i>Biblicus on the Apocalypse.</i>&mdash;I shall feel much obliged if
  any reader of "N. &amp; Q." will give me information respecting a series
  of articles which appeared about the year 1819 in some newspaper or
  periodical with the signature of <i>Biblicus</i> <!-- Page 585 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page585"></a>{585}</span>appended to them: they
  were intended, as far as I can learn, to be a sort of commentary on some
  portion of the Apocalypse. The writer left his work unfinished; but as
  many as appeared thus periodically were afterwards published in a
  separate pamphlet. I should be glad to know where a copy of this pamphlet
  is to be had; or in what paper the articles originally appeared.</p>

  <p><i>Cleopatra playing at Billiards.</i>&mdash;Perhaps one of your
  readers, more learned in Shakspeare than myself, can tell me what game he

      <p class="hg3">"<i>Cleo.</i> Let us to billiards. Come, Charmian.</p>

      <p class="i8"><i>Ant. and Cleo.</i>, Act II. Sc. 5.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Can the game of billiards, as we now have it, boast of such high
  antiquity as to have been played by "the serpent of Old Nile;" or is the
  mention of it simply one of the great poet's anachronisms?</p>

  <p><i>Burial of Sir John Moore.</i>&mdash;You have had many very
  interesting communications respecting the justly admired poem on "The
  Burial of Sir John Moore." Let me ask whether it was a matter of fact,

  who read the service is now living near Hereford, and that he will state
  that the interment took place <i>in the morning</i> after the battle.</p>

  I think they must have become scarce, as I can never find one in any

  <p>When did the laying of foundation stones first become a ceremony?</p>

  <p>What old foundation stones have been restored to light, showing the

  <p>[The information required by our correspondent is more quaint and

  and number, expressed by those letters inserted in larger characters;
  which are to be taken separately and added together, according to their

  <p>The lady who is commemorated in this inscription was the daughter of
  Sir Edwald Seymour of Berrie Castle, in Devonshire, Baronet, and wife of
  "the excellently-accomplished Sir George Farewell, Knight, who died May
  14, 1647;" as it is recorded on his monument at Hill-Bishops. In the same
  epitaph it is stated, that she was the mother of twenty children, and
  that she died Dec. 13, 1660; and the inscription concludes with these
  verses to the united memory of Sir George and Lady Farewell:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"A person graceful, learn'd, humble, and good,</p>
      <p>Well match'd with beautie, virtue, and high blood:</p>
      <p>Yet, after sufferings great and long, both dead</p>
      <p>To mind us where great worth is honouréd."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Collinson's <i>Somersetshire</i>, vol. iii. p. 255.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The practice of making chronograms for the expressing of dates in
  books, epitaphs, and especially on medals, was extremely common in the
  sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. One of the most remarkable is that
  commemorating the death of Queen Elizabeth:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"My Day Is Closed In Immortality:"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>the arithmetical formula of which is M = 1000 + D = 500 + C = 100 +
  III = 3 = <span class="sm">A. D.</span> 1603. In the second paper by
  Addison on the different species of false wit (<i>Spectator</i>, No. 60)
  is noticed the medal that was struck of Gustavus Adolphus, with the
  motto:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"ChrIstVs DuX ergo trIVMphVs."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>"If you take the pains," continues the author, "to pick the figures
  out of the several words, and range them in their proper order, you will
  find they amount to MDCXVVVII, or 1627; the year in which the medal was
  stamped."</p>

  <p>There is one peculiarity in the chronogram sent by our correspondent,
  which singularly illustrates a passage in Shakspeare, and by which also
  it is most amusingly illustrated. It will be observed, that the Rev. G.
  Newton takes advantage of the double letters at the end of Farewell, to
  express 100: and it will be remembered that "good M. Holofernes," in
  <i>Love's Labour's Lost</i>, introduces the same thought into his sonnet
  as an exquisite and far-fetched fancy:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"If Sore be sore, then <i>L to Sore</i></p>

  <p><i>Order of the Cockle.</i>&mdash;What sort of Order was this? Was it

  Knox in his <i>History of the Reformation of Religion in Scotland</i>
  (book v.):</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In the end of January [1566] arrived an ambassador from France, named
  Monsieur Rambullet, having with him about forty horse in train, who came
  from England. He brought with him the Order of the Cockle from the King

  in the chapel of the palace of Holyrood House."</p>

  <p>In 1548, also, the Duke of Chatelherault, and the Earls of Huntly,

  Seller was another Nonjuror, and had also collected an excellent study of
  books; but as he was a man of less learning than Dr. Thomas Smith [the
  editor of Bede], so his books were inferior to them, and heaped together
  with less discretion." Another notice of him occurs in Granger's <i>Biog.

  College, Cambridge, has a copy of <i>Konigii Bibliotheca</i>, interleaved

<h3>REPLY TO MR. HICKSON'S OBJECTIONS.</h3>

<p class="ac">Vol. v., pp. 554. 573.)</p>

  <p>That <span class="sc">Mr. Hickson</span> should have discovered no
  graver objections to certain suggestions of mine respecting the text of
  Shakspeare than those he has brought forward, is of itself no slight
  testimonial in their favour.</p>

  <p>In one instance I have already (Vol. v., p. 210.) shown <span
  class="sc">Mr. Hickson</span> (I trust <i>satisfactorily</i>) that his
  then somewhat similar objection had no weight; nor do these now advanced
  appear much more formidable.</p>

  <p>As to the passage from <i>As You Like It</i>, which <span
  class="sc">Mr. Hickson</span> remarks is capable of a moral as well as a
  physical interpretation&mdash;undoubtedly it is! But, in the first place,
  it must still remain a matter of opinion <i>which</i> sense best accords
  with the context: and, secondly, even admitting the moral sense to be the
  true one, still it does not necessarily disturb the analogy between it
  and <!-- Page 588 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page588"></a>{588}</span>Imogen's allusion to the <i>jay of
  Italy</i>. In that case, also, the <i>moral</i> sense may be understood
  as implying the absence of all principle other than that derived from her
  own gaudy vanity.</p>

  <p>Were I disposed to cavil, I might, in my turn, question <span
  class="sc">Mr. Hickson's</span> estimate of Phebe's beauty. Surely
  Rosalind's depreciation of it is not real, but only assumed, for the
  purpose of humbling, Phebe! <i>Inky brows, black silk hair, bugle
  eye-balls, cheek of cream</i>&mdash;these are not items in a catalogue of
  ugliness!</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Hickson's</span> second objection (p. 573.) is to
  my explanation of the demonstrative <i>that</i> in the Duke's opening
  speech in <i>Measure for Measure</i>. He thinks that, according to "the
  language we in England use," the Duke would have used the word
  <i>this</i> instead of <i>that</i>.</p>

  <p>Does <span class="sc">Mr. Hickson</span> seriously mean to say that
  Shakspeare's language is to be scanned by our present ideas of
  correctness? Is the bold sweep of the Master's hand to be measured by the
  graduation of modern convention? Are there no instances in Shakspeare of
  the indiscriminate substitution of personal and impersonal
  pronouns&mdash;of active and passive participles&mdash;of words and
  phrases waiting upon the magician's wind, like familiar spirits, to be
  moulded to his will, and acknowledging no rule but of <i>his</i>
  creation?</p>

  <p>But, in the present case, I will not admit that any such licence is
  necessary. To <span class="sc">Mr. Hickson's</span> question, "Is this
  the language we in England use?" I answer, It is!</p>

  <p>We do, even at the present day, say to a messenger, "Take <i>that</i>
  to," &amp;c., even before we have transferred the missive from our hand
  to his. I can even fancy an individual, less anxious perhaps about
  grammar than benevolence, stretching forth to some unfortunate, and
  exclaiming, while yet his intended gift was in his own keeping, "<i>There
  needs but</i> <span class="sm">THAT</span> <i>to your relief&mdash;there
  it is!</i>"</p>

  <p>It does not seem to have occurred to <span class="sc">Mr.
  Hickson</span> that the same "fatal objection" which he brings forward
  against <i>that</i>, might also be pleaded against <i>there</i>. When the
  Duke says, "<i>There</i> is our commission:" why not, "<i>Here</i> is our
  commission"? <i>There</i> stands precisely in the same relation to
  <i>that</i>, as <i>here</i> does to <i>this</i>!</p>

<h3>THE TERM "MILESIAN."</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. v., p. 453.)</p>

  <p>In reference to the communication of <span class="sc">Mr.
  Richards</span>, but I have not seen <span class="sc">Mr. Fraser's</span>
  Query, I beg to observe, for the honour of "Old Ireland," that upwards of
  thirty years since, the Royal Irish Academy awarded to me a prize of
  80<i>l.</i>, with the Cunningham gold medal, for an <i>Essay on the
  Ancient History, &amp;c. of Ireland</i>. It was published in the
  sixteenth volume of their <i>Transactions</i> to an extent of 380 pages
  quarto; and Mr. Moore has done me the honour to write to me, that it was
  his guide throughout the first two volumes of his history of this
  country. In that Essay, I have written very fully of the "Milesian"
  colonisation; so called, not directly from Milesius himself, but from his
  two sons, Heber and Heremon, who led the expedition. The native annalists
  represent the course of the emigrants through the Mediterranean by such
  progressive stages as indicate the state and progress of the
  Ph&oelig;nicians after their exodus under the conduct of Cadmus; though
  the ingenuity of the Bards occasionally introduced that colouring of
  romance, which perhaps can alone make very remote objects
  distinguishable. External testimonies of these oriental wanderers are
  traceable through <i>Herodotus</i>, lib. iv. c. 42.; <i>Pliny</i>, c.
  86.; Nennius, <i>Hist. Britt.</i>, c. 9.; Thomas Walsingham, <i>Ypodigma
  Neustriæ</i> ad ann. 1185. The venerable <span class="sc">Wintoun</span>
  adopts all the traditions of the Irish Chronicles on the subject
  (<i>Cronyk. of Scotl.</i>, lib. ii. c. 9.); and Macpherson declares
  (<i>Dissertation</i>, p. 15.) that such of the ancient records of
  Scotland as escaped the barbarous policy of Edward I. support this
  account. The writers on Spanish history, the <i>Hispania Illustrata</i>,
  De Bellegarde's <i>Hist. Gen. d'Espagne</i>, vol. i. c. i. p. 4., Emanuel
  de Faria y Sousa, &amp;c., carry the links through Spain; and such indeed
  has been the long and general faith in the tradition, that it has been
  actually embodied, even to the names of those alleged leaders Heber and
  Heremon, in an act of parliament (of Ireland I must admit) in the
  eleventh year of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and through an occurrence
  therein engrafted upon it is expressly derived one of Her
  Majesty's&mdash;</p>

<h3>BEN. JONSON'S ADOPTED SONS.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. v., p. 537.)</p>

  <p>I doubt if <i>Alexander</i> Brome was one of Ben. Jonson's adopted
  sons. It is not improbable, however, that <i>Richard</i> Brome (author of
  the comedies of <i>The Northern Lass</i> and the <i>Antipodes</i>) was
  one. In Ben. Jonson's <i>Underwoods</i> is a poem to Richard Brome "on
  his comedy of <i>The Northern Lass</i>," which commences thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"I had you for a servant once, Dick Brome,</p>
      <p class="i1">And you perform'd a servant's faithful parts;</p>
      <p>Now you are got into a nearer room</p>
      <p class="i1">Of fellowship, professing my old arts."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Thomas Randolph was certainly one of Jonson's sons. See in his
  <i>Poems</i> (4th edit. p. 17.): "A <!-- Page 589 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page589"></a>{589}</span>gratulatory to M. Ben.
  Jonson for his adopting of him to be his <i>son</i>."</p>

  <p>In Jonson's <i>Underwoods</i> is a poem "To my <i>dear Son</i> and
  right learned Friend Master Joseph Rutter." This is in praise of his
  "first play," but I am unable to state what that play was; nor can I give
  further information respecting Master Joseph Rutter, than that he is
  apparently the author of "An Elegy upon Ben. Jonson" in <i>Jonsonus
  Viribus</i>.</p>

  <p>Of William Cartwright Ben. Jonson used to say, "<i>My son</i>,
  Cartwright, writes all like a man." (Campbell's <i>Specimens of the
  British Poets</i>, ed. 1841, p. 183.)</p>

  <p>James Howell was another of Jonson's sons, and has, in <i>Jonsonus
  Viribus</i>, some lines "Upon the Poet of his Time, Benjamin Jonson, his
  honoured Friend and <i>Father</i>."</p>

  <p>Shackerley Marmion seems to have been another son. See in <i>Jonsonus
  Viribus</i>, "A Funeral Sacrifice to the sacred memory of <i>his
  thrice-honoured father</i> Ben. Jonson."</p>

  <p>If Jonson really had twelve sons, it is not improbable that some of
  the following were of the number: Sir Kenelm Digby, Thomas Carew, John
  Cleveland, Sir John Suckling, Thomas May, Edward Hyde (afterwards Earl of
  Clarendon), Owen Feltham, Jasper Mayne, Richard West, John Vaughan,
  Thomas Hobbes.</p>

  <p>I should have been disposed to have added to the above illustrious
  list the name of Edmund Waller, but for a statement of Aubrey, who says,
  "He told me he was not acquainted with Ben. Jonson" (Aubrey's
  <i>Lives</i>, p. 564.).</p>

  <p>Aubrey (<i>Lives</i>, p. 413.), speaking of Ben. Jonson, says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Serjeant Jo. Hoskins, of Herefordshire, was his <i>father</i>. I
  remember his sonne (S<sup>r</sup> Bennet Hoskins, baronet, who was
  something poeticall in his youth), told me, that when he desired to be
  adopted his son, 'No,' sayd he, ''tis honour enough for me to be your
  brother; I am your father's son, 'twas he that polished me, I do
  acknowledge it.'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I observe that, prefixed to Randolph's <i>Poems</i>, are some lines by
  Richard West, B.A., and student of Christ's Church: "To the pious Memory
  of my dear <i>Brother-in-Law</i>, Mr. Thomas Randolph." As West must have
  been unmarried, and as I believe Randolph was also unmarried, it is
  possible that West calls him his brother-in-law from his being also an
  adopted son of Ben. Jonson.</p>

<h3>SHAKSPEARE'S SEAL.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. v., p. 539.)</p>

  <p>There is a very full and curious account of a <i>ring</i><span
  class="nw">-seal</span> (of which I possess two red wax impressions),
  supposed to have belonged to Shakspeare, in a work unassumingly entitled
  <i>A Guide to Stratford-upon-Avon</i>, by R. B. Wheler, published in
  1814. I presume <i>that</i> is the seal&mdash;or, rather,
  <i>ring</i><span class="nw">-seal</span>&mdash;to which reference is
  made; but how far Mr. Wheler's statements and speculations may encourage
  "belief in the genuineness of this relic," your correspondent, and others
  taking any interest in such matters, must for themselves determine.</p>

  <p>As the publication above named is before me, it may not be
  unacceptable to give a summary of Mr. Wheler's narrative, which occupies
  eight concluding pages of the <i>Guide</i>. It appears that on the 16th
  March, 1810, an ancient gold ring, weighing 12 dwts., and bearing the
  initials "W. S.," engraved in Roman characters, was found by a labourer's
  wife upon the surface of the mill-close adjoining Stratford churchyard,
  being the exact spot whereon Mr. Oldaker since erected his present
  residence. It had undoubtedly been lost a great many years, being nearly
  black; and, continues Mr. W.,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Though I purchased it upon the same day, for 36<i>s.</i> (the current
  value of the <i>gold</i>), the woman had sufficient time to destroy the
  'precious <i>ærugo</i>' by having it unnecessarily immersed in
  <i>aquafortis</i>, to ascertain and prove the metal, at a silversmith's
  shop, which consequently restored its original colour. It is of tolerably
  large dimensions, and evidently a gentleman's ring of Elizabeth's age.
  Similar seal-rings are represented on cotemporary paintings and
  monuments: and the crossing of the central lines of the 'W.' with the
  oblique direction of the lines of the 'S.' exactly agree with the
  characters of that day. For proof we need wander no farther than
  Stratford Church, where the Totness and Clopton tombs will furnish
  representations of rings, and Shakspeare's monument of letters, perfectly
  corresponding in point of shape. The connexion or union of the letters by
  <i>the ornamental string and tassels</i>" [or <i>True Lover's Knot</i>,
  according to your correspondent], "was then frequently used, of which
  numberless instances may be found upon seals and upon inscriptions, in
  painted windows, and in the title-pages of books of that period; and for
  further coincidence of circumstances, it may be observed over the porch
  leading into the hall of Charlcote House near Stratford (erected in the
  early part of Elizabeth's reign, by the very Sir Thomas Lucy said to have
  prosecuted Shakspeare for deer-stealing), that the letters 'T. L.' are
  surrounded in a manner precisely similar."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>After adverting to many vain efforts made by him to discover whether
  there existed anywhere Shakspeare's seal attached to letter or other
  writing, Mr. Wheler states that he had examined&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A list of all the inhabitants of Stratford assessed to the levies in
  1617, wherein I cannot discover any apparently <i>respectable</i> person
  the initials of whose name agree with 'W. S.:' but from this assessment,
  though probably copied from an anterior one, nothing conclusive can be
  estimated, it being made in the year subsequent to Shakspeare's death;
  and I should, from a close observation of the ring, be inclined to
  suppose that it was <!-- Page 590 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page590"></a>{590}</span>made in the early part of the poet's life.
  Mr. Malone, in a conversation I had with him in London," (adds Mr.
  Wheler), "the 20th April, 1812, about a month before his death, said that
  he had nothing to allege against the probability of my conjecture as to
  its owner."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Mr. W. afterwards proceeds:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"That such a seal was used by a person connected with Shakspeare by a
  marriage is certain; for I possess an impression of the seal (and
  apparently a seal-ring) of Adrian Quiney, bailiff of Stratford in
  1559-60; and who, I have every reason to believe, was the uncle of Thomas
  Quiney, our poet's son-in-law. This seal of Quiney's, which is appended
  to a deed dated June 28, 9 Eliz., 1567, being a conveyance of property in
  Bridge Street, Stratford, very minutely corresponds with the Shakspeare
  ring in size, and has a very near resemblance to it in <i>the string and
  tassels</i> uniting the Roman initials 'A. Q.;' which ornamental junction
  is carved somewhat similar to what is now called <i>The True Lover's
  Knot</i>, and in the Shakspeare ring the upper bow or flourish resembles
  a heart."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In Shakspeare's age&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Seal-rings were very fashionable, but were probably more limited than
  at present to the nobility and respectable families; for I still confine
  myself to the respectability of its proprietor.... After numerous and
  continued researches into public and private documents, I find no
  Stratfordian of that period so likely to own such a ring as
  Shakspeare."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Mr. Wheler concludes&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"At present, I possess no positive proof whatever. Let it be
  remembered that my observations are merely relative. I yet hope to meet
  with an impression of the ring in my possession; and in this I am more
  particularly encouraged by the fact, that should success attend the
  investigation, this seal-ring would be the <i>only existing article</i>
  <span class="sm">PROVED</span> to have originally belonged to our
  immortal poet."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>When Mr. Wheler wrote, the signatures in Montaigne's work, &amp;c. had
  not been restored to the light.</p>

<h3>REASON AND UNDERSTANDING ACCORDING TO COLERIDGE.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. v., p. 535.)</p>

  <p>Your correspondent <span class="sc">C. Mansfield Ingleby</span> will
  pardon me if I deny the discrepancy in Coleridge's statements on the
  difference between these faculties. Coleridge refuses to brutes the
  possession of reason as a contemplative faculty; he allows them, that
  which in kind differs from reason, the understanding <i>in a certain
  degree</i>, and asserts that they do possess, in a very marked and
  characteristic manner, instinct, which, in degree only, falls below
  understanding. Instinct is distinguishable in <i>degree</i> from
  understanding. Reason is distinguishable from it in <i>kind</i>. Some
  kinds of brutes, as dogs and elephants, possess more intelligence than
  others, as tigers and swine; and some individual dogs possess more of
  this intelligence than others. This intelligence arises from the superior
  activity of the "faculty judging according to sense;" and, when Coleridge
  says that it is not clear to him "that the dog may not possess an
  analogon to words," he might have gone, I think, further, and have said,
  with much probability of truth on his side, that the dog <i>has</i> this
  analogon of words. I am sure I have often known a dog's thoughts by his
  own way of expressing them, far more distinctly than I am sometimes able
  to gather a fellow man's meaning from his words. Nay, much as I love and
  venerate Coleridge&mdash;his goodness, his genius, his writings, his
  memory&mdash;I find a dog sometimes far more intelligible. Language is a
  property of the understanding, but it cannot be developed in words unless
  there be in the creature an adequate degree of the faculty. This degree
  of the faculty, dogs have not. If they had it, they might fairly be
  expected to speak, read, and write. What we want is the man, or the
  observation and experiment, which shall show us where the line is to be
  drawn, if in the nature of such gradations lines can be drawn at all,
  which shall distinguish the degree at which instinct overlaps
  understanding. The case is perhaps too hopelessly complicated. Coleridge
  has carefully guarded his expressions, that they should not seem to
  assert for brutes more than he can <i>prove</i> that they possess, by the
  use of the words "analogous or fully equivalent." That brutes can and do
  reflect, abstract, and generalise, it needs but an understanding of the
  terms, and some observation of their habits, to feel assured.</p>

<h3>"THE MILLER'S MELODY," AN OLD BALLAD.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. v., p. 316.)</p>

  <p>The original ballad of "The Miller's Melody" is the production of no
  less a person than a "Doctor in Divinity," of whom the following are a
  few brief particulars.</p>

  <p>James Smith was born about 1604, educated at Christ Church and Lincoln
  Colleges, in Oxford; afterwards naval and military chaplain to the Earl
  of Holland, and domestic chaplain to Thomas Earl of Cleveland. On the
  Restoration of Charles II. he held several Church preferments, and
  ultimately became canon and "chauntor" in Exeter Cathedral. He was
  created D.D. in 1661, and quitted this life in 1667. Wood informs us he
  was much in esteem "with the poetical wits of that time, particularly
  with Philip Massinger, who call'd him his son."</p>

  <p>I have an old "broadside" copy of the ballad in question, "Printed for
  Francis Grove, 1656," which is here transcribed, <i>verbatim et
  literatim</i>, for the especial benefit of your numerous readers. It may
  also be found in a rare poetical volume, entitled <i>Wit Restored</i>,
  1658, and in Dryden's <i>Miscellany Poems</i> (second edition, which
  differs materially from the first).</p>

  <p>As this old ditty turns upon the making "a viol," it may be as well to
  add that this instrument was the precursor of the violin: but while the
  viol was the instrument of the higher classes of society, the "fiddle"
  served only for the amusement of the lower. The viol was entirely out of
  use at the beginning of the last century.</p>

  <p>Moll (or Mall) Symms (mentioned in the thirteenth stanza) was a
  celebrated dance tune of the sixteenth century. The musical notes may be
  found in <i>Queen Elizabeth's Virginal Book</i>, in the Fitzwillian
  Museum, Cambridge; and in the curious Dutch collection, <i>Neder Lantsche
  Gedenck clank</i>, Haerlem, 1626.</p>

<h3>SURNAMES.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. v., p. 509.)</p>

  <p>I shall endeavour to answer some of <span class="sc">Mr.
  Lower's</span> Queries.</p>

  <p>1. Names having the prefix <i>Le</i> and ending in <i>er</i> or
  <i>re</i>. They are undoubtedly Norman or French, and generally relate to
  personal trade or employment, as <i>Le Mesurier</i>, <i>Le Tellier</i>,
  <i>Le Tanneur</i>, <i>Le Fevre</i>. Another class with the prefix
  <i>Le</i>, but of various terminations, are obviously of French origin,
  as <i>Leblanc</i>, <i>Lenoir</i>, <i>Lebreton</i>, <i>Lechaplin</i>,
  <i>Lemarchant</i>. All these came to us by the French Protestant
  refugees, or from Jersey and Guernsey.</p>

  <p>2. The meaning of <i>worth</i>. This word generally implies a
  <i>military work</i>, and, I think, an <i>earth-work</i>; and I doubt
  whether <i>worth</i> and <i>earth</i> are not from the same root; I
  personally have been able to trace <i>works</i> in many places whose
  names end in <i>worth</i>. I am satisfied all such surnames were
  <i>local</i>, that is, derived from <i>places</i> so named from military
  mounds or <i>earth-works</i>.</p>

  <p>3. The meaning of <i>Le Chaloneur</i>. It is evidently the same as our
  English name <i>Challoner</i>, which Cole admits into his dictionary as
  "the name of an ancient family." It means in old French either the
  <i>boatman</i>, from "chalun," a boat; or a <i>fisherman</i>, from
  "chalon," a kind of net. As we have in English <i>Fisher</i>, in modern
  French <i>Lepécheur</i>, in Italian <i>Piscatory</i>.</p>

  <p>4. <i>Le Cayser.</i> The same as <i>Cæsar</i>, a name now, we believe,
  extinct amongst us, but preserved in our literature by Lord Clarendon and
  Pope. I suspect that it was of a class of <i>fancy</i> names which I
  shall mention presently.</p>

  <p>5. Baird and Aird are Scotch names, and probably local. Jameson (whose
  authority is very low with me) derives <i>Baird</i> from <i>bard</i>, and
  <i>Aird</i> he does not mention. <i>Aird</i> or <i>ard</i> is Celtic for
  <i>high</i>, and is a common local denomination in Scotland and
  Ireland.</p>

  <p>6. For the rest of the out-of-the-way names <span class="sc">Mr.
  Lower</span> mentions I can give no more explanation than of many
  thousands others which have been probably produced by some peculiarity or
  incidents in the first nominee, or some corruption of a better known
  name. As to this class of fancy names, I can give <span class="sc">Mr.
  Lower</span> a hint that may be of use to him. It used to be the custom
  at the old Foundling Hospital and in all parish workhouses, to give the
  children what I venture to call <i>fancy</i> names. I remember being
  shocked at the heterogeneous nomenclature that was outpoured on fifty or
  a hundred poor babes at the Foundling. I happened once to accompany a
  noble lady&mdash;the daughter of a great sea officer&mdash;to one of
  these Foundling christenings, when the names of Howe, Duncan, Jervis, and
  Nelson, were in fashion, and they were each given to half-a-dozen
  children; and while this was going on, my fair and noble friend whispered
  me, "What a shame! all these poor little creatures will grow up to be our
  cousins." Sometimes the names given were grotesque, such as ought not to
  have been permitted; and sometimes the children brought into the
  hospital, pinned to their clothes, names in which I suppose the poor
  mother may have had a meaning, but which seemed to us fantastical and
  extravagant.</p>

  <p>Illegitimacy is a considerable source of strange names. I could give
  some droll instances. Corruption is another; there are half-a-dozen names
  of labourers in my village which are mere corruptions by vulgar
  pronunciation of some of the noblest names of the peerage.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Lower</span> cannot have failed to observe the
  <!-- Page 593 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page593"></a>{593}</span>great tendency in the United States to
  vary the orthography, and of course, I suppose, the pronunciation of some
  of their old English patronymics; not from any dislike to them, for the
  contrary sentiment, I believe, is very prevalent, but the emigrants who
  carried out the names were ignorant or indifferent as to the true
  orthography or pronunciation, and in time the departure grows more wide.
  Instances of this may be also found in the small towns of England, where
  <span class="sc">Mr. Lower</span> will find on the signs frequent
  deviations from the usual spelling of the commonest as well as of the
  rarer names.</p>

  <p class="author">C.</p>

  <p>In glancing through Cole's MSS. in the British Museum, my eye rested
  on two paragraphs, which perhaps may be unknown to <span class="sc">Mr.
  Lower</span>. In Additional MSS. No. 5805. p. iv., Cole says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Before surnames were in use they were forced to distinguish one
  another by the addition of <i>Fitz</i> or <i>Son</i>, as John Fitz-John,
  or John the son of John, or John Johnson, as now in use. This was in the
  first Edward's time: nay, so late as the reign of Queen Elizabeth, in
  some places in France they had no surnames, but only Christian names, as
  the learned Monsieur Menage informs us: 'Il y a environ cent ans, à ce
  que dit M. Baluze, qu'à Tulle on n'avait que des noms propres, et point
  de surnoms.'&mdash;<i>Menagiana</i>, tom. i. p. 116. edit. 1729."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Again, in Cole's MSS., vol. xliii. p. 176., relating to a deed of the
  Priory of Spalding, Cole says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"One observes in this deed several particulars: first that the Priory
  used a seal with an image of the Blessed Virgin, together with one of
  their arms; if possibly they used one of the latter sort so early as this
  John the Spaniard's time, in the reign, as I conceive, of King Richard
  I., when arms for the chief gentry were hardly introduced. Among the
  witnesses are two Simons, one distinguished by his complexion, and called
  Simon Blondus, or the Fair; the other had no name as yet to distinguish
  him by, and therefore only called here 'another Simon.' This occasioned
  the introduction of sirnames, and shows the necessity of them."</p>

<h3>SIR JOHN TRENCHARD.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. v., p. 496.)</p>

  <p>Your Querist <span class="sc">E. S. Taylor</span> will find an
  interesting account of the manner in which a pardon was obtained for John
  Trenchard, afterwards secretary of state under William III., in <span
  class="sc">Mr. Hepworth Dixon's</span> work on William Penn. <span
  class="sc">Mr. Taylor</span> is evidently wrong in supposing that the
  pardon, of which he furnishes a copy, was issued in 1688, and at the very
  critical period to which he refers it. It was issued in 1686, that being
  the third year, reckoning by the old style, of King James's reign; so
  that his quotation from Pepys, and his suggestion of a reason for the
  pardon, are beside the purpose. It appears from <span class="sc">Mr.
  Dixon's</span> account, that William Penn was the mediator between
  Trenchard and the king; but the circumstances which led to it were so
  curious, that I transcribe part of the statement from page 276 of the new
  edition.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Lawton, a young man of parts and spirit, had attracted Penn's notice;
  in politics he was a state whig, and it was at his instance that he had
  braved the king's frown by asking a pardon for Aaron Smith. One day over
  their wine at Popples, where Penn had carried Lawton to dine, he said to
  his host, 'I have brought you such a man as you never saw before; for I
  have just now asked him how I might do something for himself, and he has
  desired me to obtain a pardon for another man! I will do that if I can;
  but,' he added, turning to Lawton, 'I should be glad if thou wilt think
  of some kindness for thyself.' 'Ah,' said Lawton, after a moment's
  thought, 'I can tell you how you might indeed prolong my life.' 'How so?'
  returned the mediator, I am no physician.' Lawton answered, 'There is
  Jack Trenchard in exile; if you could get leave for him to come home with
  safety and honour, the drinking of a bottle now and then with Jack would
  make me so cheerful that it would prolong my life.' They laughed at the
  pleasantry, and Penn promised to do what he could. He went away to the
  Lord Chancellor, got him to join in the solicitation, and in a few days
  the future secretary was pardoned and allowed to return to England."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It appears also frown <span class="sc">Mr. Dixon's</span> narrative,
  that Trenchard was employed by Penn to dissuade James from his bigoted
  and violent course, and that he had interviews with the king for this
  purpose. <span class="sc">Mr. Taylor</span> will find in the same place
  curious particulars, given on the authority of Lawton himself, concerning
  the intrigues which preceded the fall of James.</p>

<h3>PAPAL SEAL.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. v., p. 508.)</p>

  <p>I have in my possession a <i>leaden</i> seal, which has on the one
  side a precisely similar impression to that described by H. F. H. in p.
  508. of "N. &amp; Q.:" viz. two heads, with a cross between them, and the
  letters "<span class="sm">S P A</span> &nbsp; <span class="sm">S P E</span>"
  over them. The head under "<span class="sm">S P A</span>" has straight
  hair and a long pointed beard. The other head, under "<span class="sm">S
  P E</span>," has curled hair and a short curled beard, the whole
  surrounded with a circle of raised spots. On the other side of the seal
  is the following inscription, also surrounded by a circle of raised
  spots:</p>

<p class="ac"><img src="images/maltesex.png" class="middle" style="height:2ex;" alt="Cross" title="Cross" /><br/>
· E V G E N<br/>
I V S . P.P<br/>
· I I I I ·</p>

  <p>It was attached by a strong cord that runs through the substance of
  the seal to a parchment <!-- Page 594 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page594"></a>{594}</span>document that, some thirty years since, I
  found being cut into strips for labels for a gardener. The few fragments
  I was enabled to preserve showed that the document related to some
  conventual matter, from the repetition of the words "Abbati, Conventii,
  et Monasterii." One of the lines commences with an illuminated capital of
  about half an inch in height, as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Militanti ecdie licet immeriti disponente domino presidente"....</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Another line commences&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Persone tam religiose qua seculares necnon duces Marchione"....</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>On one of the fragments, apparently an endorsement on the back of the
  document, are the names "Anselmus," and beneath it "Bonanmy" or
  "Bouanmy." There are unfortunately no traces of the name of any place, or
  of a date. The writing is very clear and in good condition. Is the
  document a papal bull? I shall be obliged by any reply to my
  inquiries.</p>

<h3>MARKET CROSSES.</h3>

<p class="ac">(Vol. v., p. 511.)</p>

  <p>It is stated in Gillingwater's <i>History of Bury St. Edmunds</i>,
  edition 1804, that "The theatre, an elegant structure, originally the
  <i>Old Market Cross</i>, was erected in the year 1780, from a design by
  Mr. Adams."</p>

  <p>In Alexander Downing's <i>Plan of the ancient Borough of Bury St.
  Edmunds</i>, published in 1740, there is a very good view of the old
  <i>Cross</i>. It appears from this print to have been a fine old
  building; the lower part open. It is possible that there might have been
  a chapel in the upper part of the cross, as it appears in the print on
  Downing's map to have been three stories high, with a bell turret or
  tower.</p>

  <p>Downing's <i>Plan</i> is not scarce: it is one large sheet, and is
  engraved by W. C. Toms, sculpt.</p>

  <p>In Thomas Warren's <i>Plan of Bury</i>, subsequently published, there
  is a view of the <i>New</i> Cross, with the theatre above it, as built in
  1780.</p>

  <p class="author">J. B.</p>

  <p>Since I sent you a hasty Note respecting the Old Market Cross at Bury
  St. Edmunds, with reference to your correspondent's Query, I bethought me
  of the old market cross which formerly stood in the Great Market Place at
  Norwich. Blomefield, in his <i>History of Norfolk</i>, vol. ii. p. 652.,
  gives an account of that ancient cross, which is too long to quote but he
  states that "it was a neat <i>octagonal</i> building, with steps round
  it, and an <i>oratory or chapel in it</i>, with a chamber over it."</p>

  <p>Now possibly there might have been such a "chapel" in the old cross at
  Bury, wherein "Henry Gage was married in 1655;" for I put faith in all
  that Mr. Rookwood Gage said or wrote.</p>

  <p>There is still standing, at Wymondham in Norfolk, an old wooden market
  cross, with a chamber over it, supported by wooden columns: it is an
  octagon building. Blomefield makes no mention of it. An etching was
  published of this cross, by &mdash; Dixon, of Norwich, some few years
  back.</p>

  <p><i>Baxter's Shove, &amp;c.</i> (Vol. v., p. 416.).&mdash;I fear it may
  savour somewhat of presumption in me to offer the following remarks to
  one who confesses himself to be a collector of Baxter's works; but if
  they afford no information to your correspondent <span class="sc">Mr.
  Clark</span>, they may probably prove acceptable to other less sedulous
  inquirers after the writings of this truly pious man.</p>

  <p>Baxter, in his enthusiastic zeal in the cause of religion, did not
  hesitate to append to some of his popular tracts, titles more calculated
  to excite the curiosity of the vulgar than engage the attention of the
  refined reader; as the age became more enlightened, this breach of
  propriety was discontinued, and these records of genius and piety have
  been since reprinted under more appropriate appellations. If I am not
  misinformed, the title of Baxter's <i>Shove</i> has undergone this
  transformation, and now appears under that of <i>The Call to the
  Unconverted</i>. <!-- Page 595 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page595"></a>{595}</span></p>

  <p>The two following works are doubtless familiar to your correspondent,
  viz.: <i>Crumbs of Grace for &amp;c.</i>, and <i>Hooks and Eyes to
  &amp;c.</i> I think the former is the original title to <i>The Saint's
  Rest</i>; but as to the latter, I am not able to say whether it has been
  issued under any new name or not.</p>

  <p><i>Frebord</i> (Vol. v., pp. 440. 548.).&mdash;In some, if not in all,
  of the manors in this vicinity in which this right exists, the quantity
  of ground claimed as <i>frebord</i> is thirty feet in width from the set
  of the hedge.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Leicestriensis.</span></p>

  <p><i>Devil</i> (Vol. v., p. 508.).&mdash;If <span title="Diabolos" class="grk"
  >&Delta;&iota;&#x1F71;&beta;&omicron;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> was
  used as an equivalent for Adversarius, I should say that "the rendering
  <i>would</i> be accurate" in no slight degree; especially when understood
  in the juridical sense. But the "adversarius in judicio" is the character
  of the Hebrew Satan in Job, c. i. and ii., and Zechariah, c. iii.; and
  the same appears clearly in Revelations, c. 12:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before
  our God day and night."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The term <span title="diabolos" class="grk"
  >&delta;&iota;&#x1F71;&beta;&omicron;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>
  adds, to that of <span title="katêgoros" class="grk"
  >&kappa;&alpha;&tau;&#x1F75;&gamma;&omicron;&rho;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>,
  the idea of falsehood and injustice, essential to the accuser of the
  Saints, but not expressed in the latter <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'work'."
  >word</span>. Why the word should mean "a supernatural agent of evil," I
  cannot form the slightest idea. The name of a thing does not express all
  which that thing is! <i>Physician</i> does not mean a natural agent of
  good. As little can I understand how the correctness of a derivation can
  form "a case of ecclesiastical usage."</p>

  <p>With what words, manifestly and analogically Greek, but yet clearly
  derived in reality from the vague sources termed <i>Oriental</i>, nay
  even from Hebrew, are "the Septuagint and Greek Testament replete?" I say
  "clearly," because one paradoxical conjecture cannot obtain support from
  others.</p>

  <p>I am surprised that <span class="sc">Mr. Littledale</span> should be
  struck by the "similarity" of the gipsy word <i>Debel</i>, "God," "and
  our word devil," after himself admitting that our word is
  <i>diabolos</i>, and confining his attack to that "first link in the
  chain."</p>

  <p>I will add a very few words on the other point, though not relevant.
  What is holy at one time, becomes the direct contrary in subsequent times
  and circumstances. Homer's Minerva ascended to heaven <span title="meta daimonas allous" class="grk"
  >&mu;&epsilon;&tau;&#x1F70;
  &delta;&alpha;&#x1F77;&mu;&omicron;&nu;&alpha;&sigmaf;
  &#x1F04;&lambda;&lambda;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;</span>, among the
  other dæmons. But that word in modern Europe means a devil of hell.
  <i>Deva</i> and <i>Devi</i> are (I believe) god and goddess in Sanskrit.
  <i>Div</i>, in Persian (<span class="sc">Mr. L.</span> says), is a wizard
  or dæmon. I have no <i>Zend Avesta</i> at hand: but we require to know
  whether <i>Div</i> had a decidedly evil and Ahrimanian sense, in the
  language of the dualistic Pagan ages; or only in Ferdoosi and the like.
  If <i>afriti</i> is "blessed" in Zend, and "a devil" in Arabic, I again
  ask whether the allusion be to the literary remains of Arabic polytheism,
  or to Islam? I suspect the latter; and so, it would come to nothing.</p>

  <p class="author">A. N.</p>

  <p>I think <span class="sc">Mr. Littledale's</span> difficulty about the
  same Hebrew word's representing both <span title="Diabolos" class="grk"
  >&Delta;&iota;&#x1F71;&beta;&omicron;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> and
  <i>Adversarius</i> is, on the contrary, rather a confirmation of the old
  derivation. Had he forgotten that "the Adversary" is often technically
  used for the <i>Devil</i>? Surely there can be no more doubt that
  <i>Devil</i> comes from <i>Diavolo</i>, and that from <span
  title="Diabolos" class="grk"
  >&Delta;&iota;&#x1F71;&beta;&omicron;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>,
  than that <i>journal</i> comes from <i>giorno</i>, and that from
  <i>diurnus</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Mummy Wheat</i> (Vol. v., p. 538.).&mdash;Having a few grains of
  mummy wheat in my possession, I send you the following information
  concerning it, with a portion thereof as sample. About three years ago,
  when in New York, I purchased, at a sale of the Hon. Judge Furman's
  effects, a small parcel which was stated in his own writing to be
  "Egyptian wheat such as is mentioned in Scripture, and taken out of a
  mummy case."</p>

  <p>I planted a few of the grains in a flower-pot, and they came up in an
  apparently very healthy and flourishing manner, with an appearance
  similar to that represented in Scriptural illustrations as Egyptian corn.
  But after attaining a height of about two inches, I noticed that it began
  to grow sickly, and in a short time afterwards died away. Upon examining
  the mould I found some of the grains still there; but they looked as
  though some very minute insect had eaten away the entire heart, leaving
  the shell only. It seemed to me that such insect must have been within,
  and not entered the grain from without.</p>

  <p>Lately I have again tried in my garden a few of the grains I had
  reserved from the original stock. These, however, have not come up at
  all; and I find, on uprooting them, that the same sort of decay had taken
  place as occurred in New York. I am not able to forward you any of the
  husks, for they are now rotted: but I thought that some of your readers
  and your last correspondent might feel interested in knowing other
  attempts had also been made to rear mummy wheat.</p>

  <p><i>Nacar</i> (Vol. v., p. 536.).&mdash;This word is not, I believe, a
  name appropriated to any one particular shell, but is the term used for
  the pearl-like substance which, in greater or smaller quantities, forms
  the lining of many shells. This substance, frequently called
  mother-of-pearl, exhibits in some species a beautiful play of colours,
  said to be due to a particular arrangement of the particles. The words
  <i>naker</i> and <i>nacreous</i>&mdash;with <i>nacar</i> Spanish,
  <i>nacchera</i> Italian, and <i>nacre</i> French&mdash;are given <!--

  Webster's <i>Dictionary</i>, 2 vols. 4to., London 1832. The beard, or
  byssus, found in a few genera only, as <i>Avicula</i>, <i>Mytilus</i>,
  <i>Pinna</i>, and some others, is strong and silky, formed of numerous
  fibres produced from a gland near the foot of the soft animal, and
  employed by it to form an attachment to rocks or other objects. In Sicily
  this is sometimes made into gloves or stockings, more for curiosity than
  use. A byssus now before me measures six inches in length, is delicately
  soft and glossy, varying in colour from a rich dark brown to golden
  yellow, and is nearly as fine as the production of the silk-worm.
  <i>Byssine</i> is an old name for fine silk.</p>

  different species of trees and shrubs upon which this parasitic plant has
  been found, with many localities. In this list the white, gray, black,
  and Lombardy poplars are included. The mistletoe is there stated to have
  been found growing on the oak near Godalming, Surrey; at Penporthleuny,
  parish of Goitre, Monmouthshire; also on one near Usk, and another at St.

  <p><i>The Number Seven</i> (Vol. v., p. 532.).&mdash;The reply to the
  Query of <span class="sc">Mr. Edwards</span> is, that <i>sheva</i>,
  "seven," is used indefinitely for <i>much</i> or <i>frequently</i> in
  Ruth iv. 15., 1 Sam. ii. 5., Is. iv. 1., Jer. xv. 9., and Ezech. xxxix.
  9. 12.; also in Prov. xxiv. 16., where, however, it may refer to seven
  witnesses or pledges, as in Gen. xxi. 28-30. Compare Herodotus, l. 3. c.
  8. on the seven stones of the Arabs, with Homer's <i>Iliad</i>, l. 19. v.
  243. on the seven tripods of Agamemnon. In Arabic and Hebrew the word
  <i>seva</i> means finished, completed, satiated, as in Ezech. xvi. 28,
  29. and Hos. iv. 10. Seven, as an astronomical period, is known to most
  nations, and has been from times prior to history. Clemens Alex.
  (<i>Stromat.</i> lib. vi. p. 685., Paris, 1629) says the moon's phases
  are changed every seven days. Seleucus, the mathematician, he also says
  distinguished seven phases of that luminary. He notices the seven
  planets, seven angels, seven stars in the Pleiades and in the Great Bear,
  seven tones in music, seventh days in diseases, and gives an elegant
  elegy of Solon on the changes of every seven years in man's life. Clemens
  (lib. v. p. 600., Paris, 1629) has accumulated a variety of passages from
  ancient poets on the sacredness of the seventh day. Cicero, in the
  <i>Somnium Scipionis</i>, speaks of seven as "numerus rerum fere omnium
  nodus est." The following have treated on this mystic number: <i>Fabii
  Paulini Hebdomades, sive septem de septenario libri</i>; Omeisius <i>de
  Numero septenario</i>; Philo, <i>de Mundi opificio</i>; Macrobius, in
  <i>Somnio Scipionis</i>, l. 50. c. 6.; Gellius, <i>Noct. Attic.</i> l. 3.
  10.; Censorinus <i>de die Natali</i>, c. 7.; and Eusebius, <i>de Praep.
  Evang.</i> l. 13. c. 12. The Hebrews commemorated their seventh day, a
  seventh week (Pentecost), the seventh month (commencing their
  <i>civil</i> year), the seventh year (for fallowing the land), and the
  seven times seventh year, or jubilee.</p>

  <p><i>Gabriel Hounds</i> (Vol. v., p. 534.).&mdash;The term occurs in Mr.
  Halliwell's <i>Dictionary of Archaic and Provincial Words, &amp;c.</i>,
  vol. i. p. 388., with the following, explanation:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"At Wednesbury, in Staffordshire, the colliers going to their pits
  early in the morning hear the noise of a pack of hounds in the air, to
  which they give the name of <i>Gabriel's Hounds</i>, though the more
  sober and judicious take them only to be wild geese making this noise in
  their flight.&mdash;Kennett, MS. Lansd. 1033."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The species here alluded to is the Bean Goose <i>Anser segetum</i>, of
  authors. A few of them breed in Scotland and its islands, but by far the
  larger portion breed still farther north, in Scandinavia. Of the various
  birds which resort to this country to pass the winter season the Bean
  Goose is one of the first. I have seen very large flocks in Norfolk early
  in September, where they feed on the stubbles. I have good authority for
  their appearance in Gloucestershire, in the vicinity of the Severn, by
  the last week in August. This is in accordance with the habits of this
  goose in some parts of the Continent; Sonnerat and M. de Selis Longchamps
  calling it <i>L'oie des moissons</i>, or Harvest Goose. They are
  frequently very noisy when on the wing during the night, and the sound
  has been compared to that of a pack of hounds in full cry.</p>

  <p><i>Burial</i> (Vol. v., p. 509.).&mdash;To the names already given of
  those interred in ground not consecrated, may be added that of the
  eccentric Samuel Johnson, formerly a dancing-master, but through his
  talent, wit, and gentlemanly manners, became the guest and table
  companion of the principal families of Cheshire.</p>

  <p>He is not mentioned in Chalmers's <i>Biog. Dict.</i>, and but very
  meagrely in that of Rose. The best notice of him is in the <i>Biographia
  Dram.</i>, ed. 1812, as the author of <i>Hurlothrumbo: or the
  Supernatural</i>, and five other dramatic pieces, the first of which took
  an amazing run, owing to the whimsical madness and extravagance which
  pervade through the whole piece. Besides these, he is the writer of
  another strange mystical work, which, as I do not find it anywhere
  mentioned, I will give the title of, from my copy now before me:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A Vision of Heaven, which is introduc'd with Essays upon Happiness, a
  Description of the Court, the Characters of the Quality: Politics,
  Manners, Satyr, Wit, Humour, Pastoral, Sublimity, Extasy, <!-- Page 597
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page597"></a>{597}</span>Love, Fire,
  Fancy and Taste Universal. Written by Mr. Samuel Johnson. Lond., for E.
  Withers, &amp;c., where may be had Hurlothrumbo, 1738." 8vo., two neat
  engravings, and six pages of music.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The compilers of the <i>Biog. Dram.</i> state that they had not
  discovered the date of his death; but we learn from Hanshall's <i>Hist.
  of the County Palatine of Chester</i>: 1817, 4to. p. 515., that he died
  in 1773, aged eighty-two, and was buried in the plantation forming part
  of the pleasure-grounds of the Old Hall at Gawsworth, near Macclesfield,
  in Cheshire. Over his remains is a stone (now there) with an inscription,
  stating that he was so buried at his own desire.</p>

  <p class="author">F. R. A.</p>

  <p><i>Marvell's Life and Works</i> (Vol. v., pp. 439. 513.).&mdash;I
  thought the question proposed by J. G. F. had been answered to the
  satisfaction of all unprejudiced minds by the remarks on this subject
  published long ago. (See <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, vols. xlvi. &amp;
  xlvii.; <i>Retrospective Review</i>, vol. xi., &amp;c.) I say all
  <i>unprejudiced</i> minds; for I confess that, although I am strongly
  prejudiced in favour of Marvell, yet the internal evidence of the poems
  in question is so strongly against Marvell, that I am compelled to resign
  them to their rightful owner. Any careful reader of poetry must
  acknowledge that every feature in the style is Addison's. Captain
  Thompson's having found them in MSS. in Marvell's own hand, is no proof
  of parentage, as in the same MSS. is one which undoubtedly belongs to
  Mallet, and another which has been proved to be from the pen of Dr.
  Watts.</p>

  <p>My chief reason, however, for intruding on your space is for the
  purpose of correcting a mistake into which all the biographers of Marvell
  have fallen, as to the time and place of his birth. It is again and again
  stated, without any correction, that he was born at Hull, on the 15th
  November, 1620. That he was not born at Hull I am at length reluctantly
  compelled to believe; and that the date of his birth is "March 2, 1621,"
  I can prove from authorised documents in my own possession, copied from
  MS. in his father's hand-writing.</p>

  <p>With reference to <span class="sc">Mr. Crossley's</span> hope that a
  new edition of his works might soon be published, I may say that a new
  biography of Marvell, with a selection from his works by a townsman, is
  already in the press.</p>

  <p><i>The Death-Watch</i> (Vol. v., p. 537.).&mdash;A good account of
  this small insect will be found in the second volume of the
  <i>Introduction to Entomology</i> by Messrs. Kirby and Spence. A chapter
  is devoted to the "Noises produced by Insects."</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In old houses, where these insects abound, they may be heard in warm
  weather during the whole day. The noise is produced by raising the head,
  and striking the hard mandibles against wood.</p>

  <p>"Thus sings the muse of the witty Dean of St. Patrick on the
  subject:</p>

  <div class="poem">

      <p>That lies in the old wood, like a hare in her form:</p>
      <p>With teeth or with claws it will bite or will scratch,</p>
      <p>And chambermaids christen this worm a death-watch:</p>
      <p>Because like a watch it always cries click;</p>
      <p>Then woe be to those in the house who are sick!</p>
      <p>For, sure as a gun, they will give up the ghost,</p>
      <p>If the maggot cries click, when it scratches the post;</p>
      <p>But a kettle of scalding hot water injected,</p>
      <p>Infallibly cures the timber affected:</p>
      <p>The omen thus broken, the danger is over,</p>
      <p>The maggot will die, and the sick will recover.'"</p>

  <p>The Query of M. W. B. reminds me of a family bereavement that followed
  the visit of this insect to my father's homestead. The ticking was heard
  in a closet, which opened out of the drawing-room. I first discovered it;
  and was struck with the fact that it occasionally altered the interval
  which formed the standard of the beats, though with one standard the
  beats remained punctually uniform. On examination, I found a very tiny
  insect, in shape like an elongated spider, whose "hind leg" kept beat
  with the sound; so I suppose that member to have been the instrument by
  which the ticking was effected. The family bereavement that ensued was
  the total extinction of the last dying embers of our faith in this
  world-famed omen; for unhappily, in this instance, no death ensued in our
  domestic circle.</p>

  <p><i>The Rabbit as a Symbol</i> (Vol. v., p. 487.).&mdash;It will be
  remembered that Richard of the Lion Heart, on his way to the Holy Land,
  proceeded to Sicily, where he played all manner of rough fantastic
  tricks, to the infinite disgust of the king and people of the island. On
  pretence of certain assumed claims, but the rather <i>pour passer le
  temps</i>, our Achilles and his myrmidons fixed a quarrel upon the
  reigning sovereign, Tancred the Bastard, whose immediate predecessor,
  William the Good, had married Joanna<a name="footnotetag4"
  href="#footnote4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>, Richard's sister; took forcible
  possession of an important fortress; turned the monks out of a monastery
  whose situation was convenient for the purposes of his commissariat; and
  at last, by an act of most unjustifiable aggression, laid siege to the
  city and castle of Messina, <!-- Page 598 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page598"></a>{598}</span>on whose walls was soon triumphantly
  planted the royal banner of the Plantagenets. Now the hare and rabbit
  frequently occur upon the coins of Spain and Sicily, of which countries
  they were, indeed, the particular and well-recognised symbols. (Fosb.
  <i>Ency. Antiq.</i>, pp. 722. 728.); and I would suggest that the device
  in question has reference to Richard's proceedings in the latter kingdom,
  which, in an age whose acknowledged principle was that "Might makes
  Right," would be looked upon as redounding vastly to his credit and
  renown, and most worthy, therefore, of commemoration amongst the other
  emblematic representations which give so remarkable a character to the
  monumental effigies at Rouen. Regarding it in this point of view, there
  appears to be much inventive significancy in this device, and the
  exercise of a little ingenuity would soon, I think, render manifest the
  peculiar applicability of its "singular details" to the circumstances of
  Richard's transactions with Tancred, as they are presented to us by our
  own chroniclers.</p>

  <p>The appearance of this symbol or device of a rabbit, upon old examples
  of playing cards, as referred to by <span class="sc">Symbol</span>, is
  easily accounted for. These "devil's books" came to us originally from
  Spain; and in ancient cards of that country, columbines were Spades,
  <i>rabbits</i><a name="footnotetag5" href="#footnote5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
  Clubs, pinks Diamonds, and roses Hearts.&mdash;Fosb. <i>ut sup.</i>, p.

  <p><i>Spanish Vessels wrecked on the Irish Coast</i> (Vol. v., p.
  491.).&mdash;A fair account of this eventful visitation may be expected
  from the <i>Annals of the Four Masters</i>, a work compiled within forty
  years of the occurrence, and not near so many miles removed from the
  waters over which most of its fatalities were felt:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A large fleet (says this work) consisting of eight sure ships, came
  on the sea from the King of Spain this year (1588), and some say it was
  their intention to take harbour and land on the coasts of England should
  they obtain an opportunity; but in that they did not succeed, for the
  Queen's fleet encountered them at sea, and took four of their ships, and
  the rest of the fleet was scattered and dispersed along the coasts of the
  neighbouring countries, viz., on the eastern side of England, on the
  north-eastern shores of Scotland, and on the north-western coast of
  Ireland. A great number of the Spaniards were drowned in those quarters,
  their ships having been completely wrecked; and the smaller proportion of
  them returned to Spain, and some assert that 9,000 of them were lost on
  that occasion."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This narrative is utterly innocent of the wholesale, or of any
  <i>execution</i> of the unfortunate invaders; and, in truth, our Lord
  Deputies have too much to answer for, without throwing the barbarism of
  such a massacre upon one of them. Some colouring is, however, given to
  the charge by the writings of Smith, <i>History of Kerry</i>; Cox,
  <i>Hibernia Anglicana</i>; and even Leland, <i>History of Ireland</i>,
  vol. ii. p. 322. The deviation of these Spaniards northwards can be, I
  think, accounted for by the discomfitures they sustained from the English
  and Dutch fleets, who so kept the seas east and south of England, as to
  make a circuit round the Orkney Islands, with a descent to the westward
  of Ireland, the most advisable, though as it proved, not the less
  dangerous line of return.</p>

  <p><i>Second Exhumation of King Arthur's Remains</i> (Vol. v., p.
  490.).&mdash;The details of the circumstances attending the first (I am
  not aware of any second) exhumation of these remains at Glastonbury in
  1189, have been transmitted to us by Giraldus Cambrensis, who saw both
  the bones and the inscription, by the Monk of Glastonbury, and, briefly,
  by William of Malmesbury, all cotemporaries with the event. Sharon
  Turner, in his <i>History of the Anglo-Saxons</i>, 8vo. edit., 1823, vol.

  of this remarkable discovery.</p>

  <p><i>Etymology of Mushroom</i> (Vol. iii., p. 166.).&mdash;<span
  class="sc">Dr. Rimbault</span> states that the earliest example with
  which he is acquainted of this word, being spelt <i>mushrump</i>, occurs
  in the following passage in Robert Southwell's <i>Spirituall Poems</i>,
  1595:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"He that high growth on cedars did bestow,</p>
      <p>Gave also lowly <i>mushrumps</i> leave to growe."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>I suppose that this word has been derived from <i>Maesrhin</i>, one of
  the names of the mushroom in Welsh. As the meanings of the word
  <i>rhin</i> are "a channel," "a virtue," "a secret," "a charm," none of
  which are applicable to a mushroom, I conjecture that it is a corruption
  of the word <i>rhum</i> (also spelt <i>rhump</i>), but I am unable to
  mention an instance of the word being spelt by any Welsh writer of
  ancient times. The etymology which I suggest is <i>maesrhum</i>; from
  <i>maes</i>, "a field," and <i>rhum</i>, "a thing which bulges out." This
  meaning very nearly resembles that of the French name of one kind of
  mushroom, <i>champignon</i>.</p>
